        <h1>LEGO's Origins</h1>
        <p>In late 1935, Ole Kirk Kristiansen decides to further concentrate his business on the toy production he started in 1932. The competition winner (who can claim the prize of a bottle of Ole Kirk Kristiansen’s home-made wine) is … Ole Kirk Kristiansen himself, who has played with the two Danish words LEG GODT (meaning Play Well) to produce the LEGO name. The new name is officially used from January 1936. The intention of the name is to reflect quality and children´s right to enjoyable play. Within a few years Ole Kirk Kristiansen has laid the foundations of what is to become one of the world’s leading toy making companies.

        <h1>Birth of the Brick</h1>
        <p>Godtfred Kirk Christiansen would like to make the LEGO® brick more dynamic, and by the late 1950s several people in the Development Dept. are working on the design of a LEGO Wheel. Knud Møller works quietly on his own design and in 1958 sketches some examples of a LEGO wheel. Due to the fact that he had not been delegated the task, Knud Møller Kristiansen keeps his drawings to himself. Knud Møller’s initial idea is for the wheel to sit between two LEGO bricks, but that solution proves unworkable. Instead, he produces a construction incorporating a 2x2 brick with a metal shaft, hub, and a rubber tyre which can be plugged into a 2x4 brick with holes to receive the shaft . This solution is eventually brought to Godtfred Kirk Christiansen’s attention; he likes it and has it put into production. With one or two modifications, the LEGO wheel is ready to be launched in 1962.</p>

    <p>After launching “The Extra”, Jens Nygård Knudsen does more work on his design of a new LEGO figure. He wants to create a figure with more life. Part of his solution is to design a figure with movable arms and legs. Management hears about the new figure and orders it into production. It launches in 1978 under the name: LEGO minifigure. The minifigure becomes a huge hit. In fact, so much so that at the end of 2018, the year of its 40th anniversary, the number of total minifigures produced reaches 7.8 billion. The success is easy to understand; The minifigure brings life and roleplay to the LEGO brick and being four LEGO bricks tall, without hair or headpiece, it fits perfectly with the LEGO System in Play.</p>
